const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How does Aura (our credit) work?",
    a: "Aura is our stacked credit — each feature has its own base cost and requests pay the SUM. Images start at 10 Aura, budget video at 10, motion control at 30, lip-sync at 3, upscale at 1. Resolution and length scale the price (1080p × 2, 2160p × 4). Aura never expires and rolls across every model.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use the results commercially?",
    a: "Yes. Every paid plan includes a full commercial license for the outputs you generate — ads, music videos, UGC, client deliverables. You own the renders.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which models are included?",
    a: "All of them. Seedance 2.0, Kling 3.0, Nano Banana Pro, Seedream 4.5, Sync 1.9 lip-sync, and every new model we ship. No per-model surcharge.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you store my photos?",
    a: "Uploads are stored privately in your account so you can re-render. You can delete any asset at any time from your dashboard, and we never train on user content.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I'm not happy?",
    a: "7-day refund on any unused Aura, no questions asked. Email us and we'll return your remaining balance.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get started?",
    a: "Create an account and you get starter Aura the moment you sign in — enough to test image generation and explore the studio before committing.",
  },
