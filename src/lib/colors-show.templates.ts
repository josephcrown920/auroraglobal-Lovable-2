IDENTITY LOCK: preserve the subject's exact face, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, and body proportions from the selfie. Never alter their identity.

OUTFIT: {outfit}

SCENE LOCK — reproduce this studio exactly: {color} Cyclorama Studio — seamless curved cyc wall and floor in {color} with no visible seams. Single vintage silver studio microphone hanging on a thin cable from center-top descending to chest height. Warm {color}-tinted softbox key from camera-right, soft {color} rim light from behind. Faint floor reflection of the subject's silhouette. No furniture.

CAMERA & FRAMING: Full-body performance shot, head to toe, subject centered, vertical 9:16 portrait, 50mm at eye level, gentle depth of field.

PERFORMANCE: Natural mic-interaction stance — one hand lightly near the hanging mic, body turned slightly toward camera, eyes meeting the lens, subtle implied motion.

IDENTITY LOCK: preserve the subject's exact face, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, and eye detail from the selfie. Never alter their identity.

OUTFIT: {outfit} — only the neckline and collar are visible at the bottom of frame.

SCENE LOCK — reproduce this studio exactly: {color} Cyclorama Studio — {color} seamless backdrop filling the frame behind the subject. Warm {color}-tinted softbox key from camera-right, soft fill from camera-left. The hanging vintage silver microphone is softly blurred in the upper background.

CAMERA & FRAMING: Intimate beauty close-up, framed from upper chest to crown, face fills the frame, background softly bokeh'd, 85mm portrait lens at f/1.8. Crisp catch-lights in the eyes.
