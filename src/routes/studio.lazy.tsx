Use an exact suspended vintage studio microphone — photoreal shape, size, material, cable — hanging from ceiling at chest level. Environment is a seamless ${color} cyclorama studio — background and floor are one continuous ${color} color, no visible edges or corners. Soft even glossy lighting with smooth gradient. Subject stands on a circular performance platform matching the ${color} tone, slightly elevated with subtle shadow and faint reflective sheen. Preserve exact facial likeness, beard, skin tone, hairstyle, body proportions. Outfit identical to the outfit reference. Cinematic studio lighting, gentle floor shadow, rim light separation, ultra-realistic skin texture, natural pores, sharp clothing detail, high-end music video aesthetic, 4K photoreal quality.`;

Subject turned slightly to side but mostly facing camera — approximately 30-45° angled pose, majority of face visible. Use an exact suspended vintage studio microphone — identical design, metallic finish, hanging cable — positioned in front at mouth level. Environment is a seamless continuous ${color} cyclorama background filling entire frame top to bottom, no visible floor line, corners, or edges. Preserve exact facial likeness, beard, hairstyle, skin tone, proportions. Outfit identical to the outfit reference. Pose natural and expressive as if mid-performance, hands slightly raised or gesturing.

Place the subject outdoors in the location reference as the main background environment, and incorporate the prop/vehicle from the prop reference behind the subject — naturally placed, correct scale and angle. Match the pose reference exactly: same body positioning, framing, perspective, and camera angle. Include a vintage hanging microphone suspended directly in front of the subject at mouth level. Apply true cinematic shallow depth of field — subject and microphone razor-sharp, background softly blurred with natural optical bokeh and realistic lens falloff. Visual style of ARRI Alexa cinema camera with high-quality prime lens: filmic color science, natural highlight roll-off, accurate dynamic range, professional golden-hour outdoor lighting. Advanced skin realism — authentic pores, micro-texture, fine lines, natural asymmetry, freckles, vellus hairs, real matte vs oily zones, no smoothing or plastic artifacts. High-fidelity eye detail with crisp iris texture, accurate subsurface light, refined eyelids and lashes. Ultra-photorealistic, seamless blending, accurate proportions, true optical depth, 4K, no text or logos.`;

Subject at 30° angle to camera with direct confident eye contact. Ultra-photorealistic: natural skin pores, micro-texture, individual hair strands, precise fabric weave.
