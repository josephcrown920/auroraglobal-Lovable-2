# Aurora stacked (Kling/Runway-style) pricing

Single source of truth for cost: `src/lib/pricing.ts` (pure, no server imports so the
client UI can import it). Every charge/preview point must route through it so a quoted
preview can never disagree with what is reserved/charged: the public `/api/public/generate`
route, the AI Router server fns (`quoteGenerate` + `orchestrateGenerate`), and the AI
Router UI (`orchestrate.tsx`). The total is persisted via the existing `credits_cost`
field only — no DB migration.

## Durable design rules
- **Stacked, not flat:** a request is charged the SUM of every active feature's base, then
  resolution and length multipliers apply per-feature; the TOTAL is `Math.ceil`'d, min 1 for
  a non-empty request, empty → 0. Per-feature subtotals are kept exact so the itemized lines
  sum to the displayed total.
- **Resolution** scales video/motion always, and image ONLY when there is no temporal output
  (video/motion) in the stack (a source image under a video is base-only). This is what keeps
  the canonical worked example at exactly 39 Aura.
- **Length** scales only time-based features (video/lipsync/motion), linear vs `referenceSeconds`.

## Conservative detection (do NOT regress)
**Why:** so single-feature prices stay identical to before and charges are predictable.
`detectFeatures` derives billable features from EXPLICIT operations/inputs only — never from
prompt text and never from incidental reference artifacts. A start image for a video, or a
stray audio URL alone, must NOT add a billable feature. Add-ons only fire on explicit signals:
`motion` when a camera-control preset is supplied to a video; `lipsync` only for an unambiguous
audio+video pair on a non-lipsync primary.

## Flat product rates + MCP tools drift unless derived from computeCost
**Why:** during the 2026-07-08 video/motion doubling, the MCP motion tools were found
already stale — hardcoded `_amount` values a full repricing behind the in-app Transfer
Motion/Performance Shot charges, silently undercutting the app.
**How to apply:** any surface that charges a FLAT amount for a video-family product
(UGC ad, content-machine per-video, tiktok remix cut, MCP tools) must either call
`computeCost()` directly or use a named constant in pricing.ts whose value is asserted
against `computeCost` in tests. When repricing video/motion tiers, sweep for hardcoded
`_amount:` literals in non-test source — only `_amount: 1` (image) should remain.
Marketing copy (landing FAQ, PricingSection pack math, chatbot system prompt, CLI page)
is a fourth surface that must be updated by hand.

## There are TWO charge paths for video/lip-sync — reprice BOTH
**Why:** the AI Router (`orchestrate` server fn + `/api/public/generate`) is NOT the only
place credits are charged. The Studio surface (`src/lib/studio.functions.ts` →
`generateVideoFromImage`, `lipSyncVideo`, used by `studio.tsx` and `motion.tsx`) is a
SEPARATE charge path that historically used flat `COST_VIDEO`/`COST_LIPSYNC` constants and
silently bypassed model tiering — so premium models picked in the Studio/Motion pickers were
undercharged.
**How to apply:** any change to video/lip-sync pricing must thread the chosen `model` into
`computeCost()` in BOTH paths. In studio.functions.ts the CHARGE and the failure REFUND must
call `computeCost` with identical params (video: model+duration+resolution; lipsync: model)
or a failed render under/over-refunds. The UI previews (`studio.tsx` videoCost/lipsyncCost,
`motion.tsx` animateCost) must call computeCost with the SAME fixed params the server fn uses
(Studio/Motion animate run video at 5s/720p) so preview == charge. `pricing.test.ts` has a
picker-parity guard: every model in `VIDEO_MODEL_LIST`/`LIPSYNC_MODEL_LIST` must exist in the
tier maps, so a new picker option can't silently fall through to the default tier.

## Override must be additive — never a credit bypass
**Why:** a caller-supplied `features[]` that REPLACES the primary kind lets someone submit
`kind:"video", features:["image"]` and reserve 1 Aura while running a video — a real billing
bypass (architect-flagged). 
**How to apply:** `detectFeatures` always folds the primary `kind` into the override set, so an
override can only ADD features (raise cost), never drop the kind. Keep it that way for any new
charge path. Also keep the quote API's accepted ranges identical to the executable charge
schema (e.g. duration 3–12) so a preview can't quote a length the generation rejects.
