# Honest, one-shot sync of the current workspace to the user's GitHub repos.
#
# Why this is NO LONGER a silent 10-minute loop:
#   The previous version looped every 10 minutes authenticating with a
#   GITHUB_TOKEN that was UNSET, so every push silently failed while it logged
#   "pushing..." — nothing ever reached GitHub. This version REQUIRES a real
#   GITHUB_TOKEN (repo + workflow scopes) and exits non-zero with a clear error
#   if anything fails. It never claims success while failing.
#
# Why it clones + strips instead of a plain `git push`:
#   The workspace git history permanently contains export .zip files larger than
#   GitHub's 100MB hard per-file limit, so a plain `git push Main` is always
#   rejected. This clones to a throwaway dir, strips every >=100MB blob from
#   history, then publishes the cleaned lineage. It ABORTS if stripping would
#   change the current tip tree (i.e. an oversized file lives in the tip and
#   could not be published to GitHub anyway) so it can never silently publish a
#   Main that is missing files.
#
# How the push works without a force-push:
#   It uploads the cleaned objects to a unique temp branch (a normal, non-force
#   push), then repoints Main to the cleaned tip via the GitHub REST API (a
#   force ref-update, which also works on a default branch), then deletes the
#   temp branch.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/github-autopush.sh
